# Changelog:
- PR #19:
    - move stream processor to its own process (not thread); delete serialReceiver.
    - tested for much improved performance.
- PR #17:
    - Add option to plot with time as x axis
        - Add usec timestamps to all messages
        - Rework internal representation of data to use ringbuffer as numpy structured array
        - Change UI dtype representation such that all fields in numpy dtype are scalars
    - Add option to save timestamps (or not)
    - In binary mode, do not include delimiter byte in dtype, nor save it
- PR #14:
    - Changing data formats didn't work while connected, but works now.
- PR #8:
    - enable saving data
    - revert to same color on all plots
    - add name for each plot
    - make names, visility, and type (analog or bitmask) of plots persistent
- PR #6:
    - Pause now respected when connecting/disconnecting
    - Unique colors for each plot
    - Allow disabling of certain streams for plotting
    - Remove margins between plots and x-axes of all plots except bottom one, so that plots can be bigger
    - Allow plotting of data series as rasters (interpreting values as bit-masks)
 - PR #4:
    - Pause didn't pause processing, just updating the plots. Pause now inhibits stream processor, so plot buffers dont update.
    - Show vertical bar for current plot position
    - Color scheme was bad for 'light' system theme. Now correctly pulls theme colors and uses them.
    - Add persistent settings when closing and re-opening app via QSettings.
 - PR #3:
    - Fix some bad bugs in ASCII parsing (would re-read same buffer if no new data were present! wouldnt parse floats correctly!)
    - UI cleanup: alignment/sizing, make plot colors match system theme.
    - Add example TCP server for testing ascii parsing.
 - PR #2:
    - Restructure as python package to allow easy install. Still works with local editable install (`pip install -e <repo path>`).
 - PR #1:
    - handle sockets, not just serial ports. you can type in a tcp/udp address into "source" and it will connect automatically.
    - handle ascii messages with numerical fields
    - add mouseover documentation for dtype_string
    - in binary, message size should be inferred from dtype_string
    - make different config options available on UI when parsing different message types
